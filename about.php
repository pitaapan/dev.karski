                    When I was 8 years old I didn’t want to become a fireman, I wanted to hack my Commodore 64. The plan was that it would be a control hub for my family home. It was supposed to control the lights, change and record TV channels, have a calendar connected to the fridge...

                    10 years later I was thinking I would make a great architect, I could design my own house with a private skate park. I wasn’t a top pupil at secondary school just because my skateboarding career seemed to have been more important at the time.

                    College years were so awesome. I studied English Linguistics (which was actually fun) and I was a local Rock Star. Some say I was only ‘Rock’ cos I wasn’t much of a star. So be it, still it was me up there on the stage not them. I will always cherish these moments performing with my band, best experience ever.

                    The age of internet has came around at the time giving a whole new lot of infinite possibilities. Finally I was able to combine and develop all my aspirations, thanks to a chunky box with an ethernet cable. This was when I realized that me and the interwebs are a match for life. People were saying that you could in fact get paid for doing all that. I must admit it sounded like a pretty good idea.

                    On top of all that, I was also lucky enough to marry a geek like me. Life is good and thank you all for being there for me. Rain or shine. Cheers!
